## Description

I initially had the idea of creating such software when I bought a drawing tablet.
I used other drawing software but it didn't feel right. I didn't know how things work and there were not many shortcuts for my liking(I use vim btw), so I decided to make my own vim drawing app(of course it won't have modes, but it will sure have a lot of shortcuts).

## Usage

### Build and Run from source

You can either build from source(fancy hey) by running the "run.sh" script which will create a jar file and also
run the project

### Download the jar file from the release tab(which is not yet out because we are still in construction)
