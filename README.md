# GrassPaint (Touch some grass by drawing some grass)

## Description

GrassPaint is a cross-platform drawing application built on Java Swing, designed for users who prioritize **keyboard-centric workflows** and speed.

I initially had the idea for this software after buying a drawing tablet and feeling constrained by the limited and rigid shortcuts in existing applications. While GrassPaint doesn't implement Vim's modal editing, it is engineered to offer a high degree of **shortcut customization** and key bindings to boost your drawing efficiency.

## Key Features (v0.9.0-Beta)

This current release includes the essential features for the core drawing engine:

- **Persistent History:** Reliable Undo/Redo stack for managing drawing actions.
- **Canvas Control:** Resizable drawing canvas and dynamic resizing upon image loading.
- **Refined UI Feedback:** The thickness slider value is only displayed while the slider is actively being dragged.
- **Core Tools:** Pencil, Eraser (with dynamic background matching), Color Picker, and color presets.
- **I/O:** Load and save artwork as PNG files(currently you have to specify the extension but in future releases they will be automatically appended).

## Shortcuts 
- `<C-o>` ->  Open a file
- `<C-s>` ->  Save file
- `<C-u>` ->  Undo action
- `<C-r>` ->  Redo action
- `<C-c>` ->  Exit application
- `<C-l>` ->  View License

- Alt + p ->  Toggle pencil
- Alt + e ->  Toggle eraser
